# INSTALLATION
==============
All distutils-able requirements *should* be satisifed by the build script. If not, please let the maintainers know.

Distutils doesn't treat numpy/scipy very well at the minute in terms of dependency declaration so it is currently recommended to use your distributions package manager version instead

Non-Pipable Dependencies
------------------------
* python-wxgtk2.8
  python-numpy
  python-scipy
  libfreetype6-dev
  libpng-dev
  libzmq-dev
